I belong to the ISE department, studiying in the third semester B section.
<br>

<br>
This is the webpage for the assignment that was given by GDG for the recruitments for the year 2025.
<br>
This webpage was written by me using HTML and then designed using CSS giving the website a more refined and a morden and to have a vibe.
<br>
I remember attending a GDG intro session workshop that google developers are allowed to use only some colours and some shades of the colours
<br>
In this website I have strictly stuck on to the colours prescribed by the google developer club and then implemented in my webpage. 
<br>
<h2>This website is named as Alt+Shift+Me. </h2>
<br>
<p>This name was decided that all the people atleast once in their life time meet a shift making them a great resource. So, this portfolio shows that how we are shifted to a new dimension and what are the skills that made us upshift in the tech domain.</p>
<br>
Hoping to join this most advanced and the most precious tech organization
<br>
<h2>And I will strive and be learning minded to build up more skills on the basic skills that I posses. It would be really great and a helpful chance if this opportunity is given to me join GDGMVJCE to build up more and more skills</h2>
<br>
Waiting for this precious opportunity and promising through this website that I will learn and be a great resource using this GDG MVJCE to upskill and be a great resource in the future for GDG and the tech industry
